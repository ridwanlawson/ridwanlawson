# Hi there, I'm Ridwan Lawson ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer based in Indonesia who loves building web and mobile applications. With over 5 years of experience in the tech industry, I have developed a strong expertise in the following programming languages:

- Node.js
- PHP

I am also highly skilled in front-end development with React and Flutter, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies to stay ahead of the game.

## ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on

I am currently working on a React-based project called MyMovieList. This application allows users to search for movies and create their own personal watchlist. The project is built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I'm constantly improving it with new features and functionalities.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning

I'm always trying to stay on top of the latest technologies and frameworks. Right now, I'm learning about Next.js and Docker, and I'm excited to integrate them into my future projects.

## ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate?

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you have a project you'd like to work on or if you just want to say hello, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
